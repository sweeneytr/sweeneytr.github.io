# Foreword

With all your computers networked together, you're going to quickly realize that
user management becomes a nightmare across machines. Users have to be added to
every machine, they need to be a part of the same groups on each machine, have
the proper permissions, etc.

The proper way to handle user authentication is to have a central user database
that the nodes on the network look to for information on what users should be
allowed into the system. That can be a bit over-the-top for small clusters, so
first I'll discuss a simple way to manage users.

# Ansible Management

Ansible is a tool for orchestrating actions across many different hosts in a
network. It can be used to install packages on different machines, configure
anything, run any command. It's truely a dream if you have any sort of a problem
that can be solved with performing an action on all the machines concurrently.
this includes adding user accounts.

Ansible is distributed through many package managers, but the latest and
greatest is available through `pip`, the python package manager. Ansible is
built on python, and runs on just about anything. The below bit of magic will
install Ansible on any system that uses aptitude.

```
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip
pip3 install ansible
```

Ansible uses a data description language called YAML to describe tasks to be run
on hosts. The below YAML describes setting up user accounts on a set of host
machines. It uses a "with items" loop (similar to a for-each loop) to add users
defined in `user-vars.yml` file to all the machines Ansible is managing.

```yaml
---
- hosts: all
  become: yes
  become_method: sudo
  vars_files:
    - user-vars.yml
  tasks:
    - name: Create users.
      user:
        name: "{{ item.name }}"
        comment: "{{ item.fullname }}"
        createhome: yes
        groups: "{{ item.groups }}"
        uid: "{{ item.uid }}"
        shell: /bin/bash
        password: "{{ item.password }}"
      with_items:
        - "{{ users }}"
```

You may notice that interestingly, the password and UID are being set for the
user. This was necessary for our architecture because we were using a
networked file system, and OSs track ownership and access permissions by user
ID and not username. Without setting the UID of each user, machines went mad as
users were signing in and their UID didn't match the UID that owned their home
directories.

Below is the content of `user-vars.yml`. You'll notice that passwords are stored
as hashes. Those hashes are generated with `mkpasswd`, the command which
normally hashes passwords that'll be stored in the `/etc/passwd`. It can be
installed with `sudo apt install whois`, and `mkpasswd -m sha-512` will generate
the passwords to be inserted into the file.

```yaml
users:
  - name: tsweeney
    password: $6$raieteigijnrlak35030/.who.would.actually.put.a.hash.online.sgf
    fullname: Tristan Sweeney
    groups: sudo
    uid: 5001

  - name: shance
    password: $6$raieteigijnrlak35030/.who.would.actually.put.a.hash.online.sgf
    fullname: Spencer Hance
    groups: sudo
    uid: 5002
```

The last bit to tie this all together is a file in `/etc/ansible/hosts`. This is
an `.ini` file that describes the hosts to be managed by Ansible. This file can
get more complicated and define values attached to hosts, but it also can be as
simple as the one below. you can use IPs or hostnames if those host names are
resolvable against DNS or `/etc/hosts`. The group of hosts `all` referred to in
the playbook implicitly refers to all the hosts defined in the hosts file.

```ini
[access_node]
pantheon-pi

[work_nodes]
pantheon-0
pantheon-1
pantheon-2
pantheon-3
```

And that's all folks, all you need to manage user accounts with ansible. All
that's left is to do is to run `ansible-playbook ./setup_users.yml
--ask-become-pass`, provide your password so ansible can run sudo tasks to add
the users, and sit pretty as Ansible churns away. Also, marvel at Ansible and
the magic it does.

# Pluggable Authentication

Luckily, those wacky Linux folks we all know identified that sysadmins would
want to have pluggable authentication modules (PAMs) that they could add to
their systems, that would allow them to have users from a central user database.
That way, you have one account of a user living out in a database, and the OS
knows to ask that database for UID, passwords, and all else.

LDAP (lightweight directory access protocol) is a protocol for accessing
directory databases. This is a (relatively) old fashioned style of database,
where hierarchical data is stored. If you're imagining that this mirrors how
you'd try to organize data on a file system: you got it. LDAP is commonly used
to store a hierarchy of user data, including login data.

LDAP is also ancient and a massive pain to set up and configure. There are
reference materials for setting it up from [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-authenticate-client-computers-using-ldap-on-an-ubuntu-12-04-vps)
which I did follow on an initial exploration LDAP authentication. My takeaway
from that foray is that you should never deal with LDAP's nonsense, and with
Ansible you never will have to.

[Ansible Galaxy](https://galaxy.ansible.com/) Provides packaged "Roles" you can
have hosts perform, which are decently maintained and developed. You can use
`ansible-galaxy install username.rolename` to install a role to your Ansible
controller. The roles `jnv.ldap-auth-client`, `bennojoy.openldap_server`,
and `net2grid.openldap_config` handle all the configuration you'll need, they
just need to be provided a simple set of parameters that are discernable from
the documents on digital ocean and the repos for the ansible roles.

```yaml
---
- hosts: all
  roles:
    - role: jnv.ldap-auth-client
      tags: ldap
      ldap_auth_config:
        ldapns/base-dn:
          type: string
          value: "dc=example,dc=com"
        ldapns/ldap-server:
          type: string
          value: "ldap://pantheon-0:389"
        pam_password:
          type: select
          value: exop
        dbrootlogin:
          type: boolean
          value: false
- hosts: openldap_servers
  become: yes
  become_method: sudo
  roles:
    - role: bennojoy.openldap_server
      openldap_server_domain_name: pantheon.ece.neu.edu
      openldap_server_rootpw: zeus
      openldap_server_enable_ssl: false

    - role: net2grid.openldap_config
      default_user_password: nucar
      openldap_create_organizationalunits:
        - Groups
        - People
        - Hosts
      openldap_create_users:
        - name: tsweeney
          cn: Tristan Sweeney
          sn: Sweeney
          password: nucar
          email: sweeney.tr@husky.neu.edu
          group_ou: ou=People
```

# Single Sign On

We didn't manage to get SSO working on our cluster, which isn't a problem for a
small cluster or a cluster with an NFS home directory where SSH keys can be
propagated, but a proper SSO authentication service would be wonderful. If I'm
at SC next year I'll explore using Kerboros for SSO.
